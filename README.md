# Homework-Reiz

My thoughts and feedback on the homework assignment:

Regarding the first task of the homework, I'm happy to report that I was able to successfully create the console app. However, I have to admit that I overthought things a bit at first. I was initially under the impression that I needed to create an analog clock in the console, which led me to spend more time than necessary on the project.

While I think that creating an analog clock in the console would be a fun and challenging project, it may not have been necessary for the assignment at hand. In the future, I'll make sure to focus more on the requirements of the task and not get too caught up in more advanced or complex ideas.

Overall, I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow through this assignment. It's been a great way to challenge myself and build my programming skills, and I'm looking forward to tackling the next task with more focus and clarity.



Regarding the second home assignment, I have to admit that I'm finding it quite difficult. I had to scan my old modules and past lessons about recursion and nodes. The problems we're being asked to solve are challenging and require a lot of effort to complete.

That being said, I recognize that difficult assignments are often the ones that provide the most opportunity for growth and learning. By pushing myself to tackle these tough problems, I'm confident that I'll be able to build skills and gain a deeper understanding of the material.

Overall, while the assignment is certainly challenging, I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow as a programmer. I'm committed to putting in the time and effort needed to succeed, and I'm confident that I'll be able to overcome any obstacles and come out stronger on the other side.
